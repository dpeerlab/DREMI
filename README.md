# DREMI

This software computes DREMI between any two proteins in CyTOF data. 

DREMI is a mutual information based technique that quantified the strength of association between any two proteins. Along with it, DREVI is a visualization technique that illustrates the underlying relationship between the two proteins.

To use:
